# CMIP6 Hackathon Project Template

## To Do:
1. Add binder functionality 
2. Make clear data analysis is being done on Google Cloud.
3. Add `dask` functionality. 
4. Add `intake-esm` demonstration
5. Add science examples
   1. Calculate CESM-LE ensemble mean global temperature with shadded standard deviation for two emissions scenarios. 
   2. For a single emmisions scenario, calculate the ensemble average precipitation south of -60 degrees timeseries for several earth system models. 
   3. For CESM-LE historical simulation calculate the annual average precipitation over Antarctica for each ensemble member. Then, at each grid cell calculate the max, min, and average. Then plot difference between max and min divided by average. This will indicate the relative importance of internal climate variability at different points over the ice sheet.
